Multiple Disease Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning

This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to predict multiple diseases based on input data, providing a comprehensive solution for healthcare applications. The goal is to use machine learning models to identify various diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.) based on diagnostic features and historical medical data.

Features

Multiple Disease Prediction: The system predicts a variety of diseases using a range of data inputs.

Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for disease prediction.

Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and missing value imputation for better model accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: Performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Cross-Validation: Ensures that the model generalizes well to unseen data through cross-validation.

Datasets

The dataset(s) used for training models contain health-related attributes such as:

Age

Sex

Blood pressure

Cholesterol levels

Glucose levels

Other clinical features

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)

Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Algorithms)
