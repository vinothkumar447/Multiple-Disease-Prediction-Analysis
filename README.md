Multiple Disease Prediction using Data Science and Machine Learning
This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to predict multiple diseases based on input data, providing a comprehensive solution for healthcare applications. The goal is to use machine learning models to identify various diseases (such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, etc.) based on diagnostic features and historical medical data.

Features:
Multiple Disease Prediction: The system can predict a variety of diseases using a range of data inputs.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks for disease prediction.
Data Preprocessing: Features like data cleaning, feature engineering, and missing value imputation are applied for better model accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: The project includes performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Cross-Validation: Applied cross-validation to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Datasets:
The dataset(s) used for training models contain health-related attributes such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, and other clinical features.
Technologies Used:
Python
Pandas, Numpy (Data Processing)
Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning Algorithms)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
Jupyter Notebook
Setup:
